## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains two CSV datasets:
  - `healthy_dataset.csv`
  - `unhealthy_dataset.csv`

- `arduino/`  
  Arduino and Python scripts used to collect real-time sensor data:
  - `ecg.ino`: Collects ECG signals
  - `four_parameters.ino`: Collects ECG, PPG, GSR, BP
  - `all_parameters_read.py`: Reads all data and saves to CSV
  - `ecg_read.py`: Reads ECG data and saves to CSV

- `streamlit/`  
  Contains the user interface:
  - `atherosclerosis_app.py`: A Streamlit app to collect 14 inputs and run the prediction

- `models/`  
  Pre-trained models and preprocessing tools:
  - `CNN-LSTM_best_model.h5`: Trained Deep Learning model
  - `scaler.pkl`: Scaler for input normalization

## üß† Features

- Collects real-time data using sensors (ECG, PPG, GSR, BP)
- Uses a CNN-LSTM hybrid model for prediction
- Web-based interface using Streamlit for entering inputs
- Predicts whether the patient is **healthy** or **at risk** of atherosclerosis
